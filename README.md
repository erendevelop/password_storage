## "Password Storage" project!
🔒This project is for your passwords to be safely stored in Firebase. 

#### 📝Note: ✔New releases upcoming!

### New Release!
📌 With this release, you could manage your passwords safely. You have a main password and this password allows you to access to the other passwords you stored in app. If you want, you could make the app remind you or don't remind and want to password in each entrance. The passwords are expandable and visibility is settable.  Enjoy the first release of it! I am looking forward to publish it ASAP. <br>
